# 100 Days Of Blockchain Code - Log

## 100 Days Of Blockchain Code is a pledge to dedicate at least 1 hour of study or coding to blockchain development for 100 days
Inspired by [Siraj Raval's 100 Days Of ML Code challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQMBj1cWPo)


### Day 1: July 18, 2018
##### Coding My Own Cryptocurrency on Ethereum

**Today's Progress**: Written First Smart Contract and began with coding front-end for ICO website.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with having a test-driven development mindset. But getting the hang of it now.

### Day 2: July 19, 2018
##### Coding My Own Cryptocurrency on Ethereum

**Today's Progress**: Deployed Smart Contract to Rinkeby test network

**Thoughts** Tried to sync with the Rinkeby test network via `geth` but I got stuck on the last 60-70 blocks. Eventually solved this by running `geth` with the `--light` flag.

### Day 3: July 20, 2018
##### Coding My Own Cryptocurrency on Ethereum

**Today's Progress**: Deployed ICO website to GitHub pages.

**Thoughts** I struggled with loading all my css and js files with the right paths because for some weird reason the `app.js` file couldn't be accessed via GitHub pages.

### Day 4: July 21, 2018
##### Coding My First DApp on Ethereum (Election DApp)

**Today's Progress**: Got started on coding the Election Smart Contract and added boiler plate code for the front-end.

**Thoughts** I did some more research on ES6 Promises and found a cleaner way of writing promise chains with `async` and `await` instead of `.then(() => {})`. I also learned about the difference between a `mapping`, `array` and `struct` in Solidity.

### Day 5: July 22, 2018
##### Coding My First DApp on Ethereum (Election DApp)

**Today's Progress**: Added the core voting functionality to Smart Contract and front-end.

**Thoughts** 

* Today I had a problem with listening for Smart Contract events when starting from `block 0`. This meant that all the previous events would trigger at the same time on a page reload. This resulted in unnecessary code execution.

* Found a way for handling errors with `async` functions without `try` and `catch` blocks.

### Day 6: July 23, 2018
##### Coding My First DApp on Ethereum (Election DApp)

**Today's Progress**: Deployed front-end to IPFS.

**Thoughts** At first at was not clear to me what the difference was between IPFS and IPNS but now I know that IPFS is the hash of the file and IPNS is the hash you can publish because that one isn't gonna change.

 ### Day 7: July 24, 2018
 ##### Coding My First DApp on Ethereum (Election DApp)
 
 **Today's Progress**: Added functionality for contract admin to dynamically add new candidates / Started refactoring Token Sale tests (`async await` instead of `then()`).
 
 **Thoughts** I didn't really have any struggles today apart from Metamask caching some things about my local test network, fixed this by changing netwerk_id of test network.

   ### Day 8: July 24, 2018
   ##### Coding My First DApp on Ethereum (Election DApp)
   
   **Today's Progress**: Added functionality for contract admin to dynamically add new candidates in the front-end / Finished refactoring Token Sale tests (`async await` instead of `then()`).
   
   **Thoughts** I faced a challenge by integrating special functionality for the Contract Owner because I didn't want everybody to know who the admin is so hard-coding the address or defining the 'admin' variable public wouldn't solve anything.
   
   Eventually, I created a getter function for the private 'admin' variable but added an 'onlyOwner' modifier to check if the address calling it is the owner. Then in the front-end, I wrapped the getter function in a 'try' block so the extra functionality would only be visable for the owner.

 ### Day 9: July 25, 2018
 ##### Coding My First DApp on Ethereum (Election DApp)
   
   **Today's Progress**: Deployed Election DApp to Rinkeby test network and deployed frontend to IPFS.
   
   **Thoughts** Today I finished my first DApp! Really learning a lot by just doing, without this challenge I would have probably procrastinated on this project.
